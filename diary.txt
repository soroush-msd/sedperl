14/04/21    10:00AM     12:00PM     Read spec       read the assignment specification
                                                    for the first time. took some notes 
                                                    about different sed commands
                                                    and assumptions.
                                                    asked my tutor for clarification
                                                    on some of the regex addresses
                                                    discussed in the tutorial.

20/04/21    12:30PM     1:30PM      speed           spend some time to familiarise myself
                                    behaviour &     with 2041 speed behaviour and thought
                                    implementation  how to process different type of
                                    design          commands for implementation

22/04/21    7:30PM      9:00PM      implementation  decided to create seperate functions
                                    of command q    to process each one of the commands.
                                    for subset 0    implemented quite command and passed
                                                    the autotests for it.

[22-23]/04/21   11:30PM  2:15AM     implementation& implemented the commands p and d along
                                    debugging of    with -n flag. debugged to pass all the
                                    commands p and  autotests for the edge cases 
                                    d with -n       (running speed with only p and without any addresses).
                                                    implemented most of subsitution command - yet to be debugged.

23/04/21    6:00PM      8:30PM      implemented     finished implementing s command. passed autotests
                                    and debugged    but the code was too repetetive. divided the s command
                                    s command       into two seperate funtions. one only to 
                                                    do the subestitution and another to process
                                                    regex line numbers and regex addresses.

23/04/21    11:00PM     12:00AM     implemented     experimented the reference implementation to 
                                    $ functionality become familiar with the behavior of this command.
                                    to address      match the reference implementation for d,q, and p.
                                    the last line   passed the relevant autotests.
                                    of inputs

24/04/21    2:00PM      3:30PM      implemented     finished implementing the $ commands for d,p,q,s
                                    $. command      passed the relevant autotests and did manual testing
                                    for s and       for edge cases and the ones not covered in autotests.
                                    tested successfully
                                    
25/04/21    9:30PM      11:30PM     writing shell   wrote some shell scripts to test different cases
                                    scripts for     for each one of the commands. Also tested some edge
                                    testing         cases with error output messages
 
26/04/21    1:00AM      2:00AM      cleaning up     added some comments to the code for better 
                                    the code        readability. removed extra lines and notes from the 
                                    and commenting  code and cleaned up the code a little.
